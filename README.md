# **Weather Station Observation Script**  

## **Overview**  
This Python script fetches real-time weather data from the Weather Underground API for a specified weather station. It displays the data in a terminal-friendly format with colored outputs to enhance readability.

---

## **Features**  
- Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind gusts, pressure, and precipitation.  
- Dynamically calculates **"Feels Like"** temperature (Wind Chill or Heat Index).  
- Uses **Colorama** for color-coded outputs based on thresholds.  
- Supports automatic dependency installation.  
- Compatible with **Ubuntu 24.04** and other Linux distributions.  

---

## **Requirements**  
- Python 3.x  
- `requests` library  
- `colorama` library
